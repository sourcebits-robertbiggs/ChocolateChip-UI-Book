#Preface

ChocolateChip-UI was created to give developers the chance to create really good looking apps. There are so many frameworks, and they approach the problem of making mobile Web apps from many angles. Depending on your needs and your background, any one of them could be the perfect solution for your development needs. In this crowded scene of development options ChocolateChip-UI stands out for two reasons: it has a very simple and clean markup for defining an app's interface, and by default the UI will look really good, with the native look and feel of each supported mobile platform.

If you want to create a great app that your users will love and will stand out from the crowd, you might want to take a look at how ChocolateChip-UI can help you achieve that goal. If you need to support several platforms and don't have the time or resources to pull it off well, you should take a look at how ChocolateChip-UI's themes handle this for you.
